This project aims to forecast product demand in a supply chain environment using machine learning techniques, specifically a neural network model. It is based on a real-world dataset from a Fashion & Beauty startup, with the objective of improving inventory planning and reducing common inefficiencies such as overstocking, stockouts, and delayed shipments. The dataset comprises diverse features, including product type, SKU, price, promotions, customer demographics, stock levels, order quantities, shipping costs, supplier names, lead times, and manufacturing-related information. The project begins with thorough data preprocessingâ€”handling missing values, dropping non-essential columns, and converting date fields into structured time-based features like month, quarter, and day of the week. Categorical variables are label encoded, and numerical features are normalized using `StandardScaler` to prepare the data for model training. The model architecture includes three hidden layers with ReLU activations, compiled with the Adam optimizer and trained using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function. Training is conducted over 50 epochs with validation to prevent overfitting. Model performance is visualized through plots of training vs validation loss and a scatter plot comparing true and predicted sales values. Once trained, the model is saved (`.h5` format) and tested on sample data to demonstrate deployment readiness. The results show that the model can provide reliable sales forecasts, which can be used to streamline inventory management, reduce operational costs, and enhance overall supply chain efficiency. This project not only demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in business but also sets the foundation for future enhancements like real-time dashboards, integration with live data sources, and predictive supply chain automation.
